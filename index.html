                        <h1>The Nissan Vmotion 2.0</h1>
                        <p>The Nissan Vmotion 2.0 concept combines a high sense of style, emotional design, space, comfort and technology to make the mobility experience seamless for busy professionals.</p>
                        <p>The Vmotion 2.0 concept’s dramatic silhouette is characterized by a "floating roof," with a line flowing seamlessly from the steeply raked A-pillars to the trunk lip. 
                                An extended wheelbase shows off the car’s generous cabin, while the distinctive body surface is defined by Nissan’s "Emotional Geometry" design language.
